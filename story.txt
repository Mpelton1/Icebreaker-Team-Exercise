John Wick arrived at Berlin with the Bratwurst.
He stood out from the crowd because he was wearing a vibrant dirndel.
The scent of gebaeck hung in the air.
The buttery scents conveniently masked those of the wet hunds creeping out from the ratskellar.
He craved apelkuchen so he headed out to baeckerei.
Sadly, as he was walking down the hauptstrasse, he dropped his bratwurst, and a passing hund snatched it up with zero remorse.
Mr. Wick felt dejected, now his plans have changed, he hopped in his Porsche to get more bratwurst.
Suddenly, the wonderful smell of doener crept through his car and he screeched to a halt.
Looking around and trying to find the smell he realizes that the doener is in Berlin, his least favorite city.
