John Wick arrived at Berlin with the Bratwurst.
He stood out from the crowd because he was wearing a vibrant dirndel.
The scent of gebaeck hung in the air.
The buttery scents conveniently masked those of the wet hunds creeping out from the ratskellar.
He craved apelkuchen so he headed out to baeckerei.
